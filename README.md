![](assets/images/hike-finder.jpg)

## **Purpose**
During times of social distancing, it is important for people to take advantage of things that still remain open, such as the outdoors, and more specifically - hiking. HIKE FINDER provides the user with a one stop shop for everything they need to know to prepare for their next adventure. 

## **Features** 
HIKE FINDER is an easy to use mobile friendly website that allows the user to find a hike in a location of their choosing by zip code, or even a specific hike name. Users can see important details about the hike such as length, altitude, weather conditions, ratings, and more. Users are also presented with a gear checklist allowing them to determine necessary preparation, including whether to take advantage of the handy storefinder feature! HIKE FINDER provides a list of sporting good stores near the user's hike or another desired location to help the user ensure they have everything they need.
